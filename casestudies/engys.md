summary: A new business model for delivering a simulation and modelling service on HPC cloud 
---

## Engys: Intro

A unique collaboration between academia and industry has created a novel simulation-as-a-service model 
offering cost effective, pay-per-use access to advanced CFD modelling on HPC cloud.    
 
Independent CFD consultancy ENGYS has developed a general-purpose CFD software solution for engineering analysis 
and design optimisation. Called HELYX, it is based on an advanced open source simulation engine that uses OpenFOAM 
technology. A collaboration with EPCC at the University of Edinburgh has created a simulation-as-a-service business 
model offering cost effective, pay-per-use access to advanced CFD modelling based on an implementation of HELYX on EPCCâ€™s 
Cirrus HPC cloud. A purpose-built, easy-to-use interface provide users with seamless migration from local desktop to 
operation on the Cirrus HPC cloud, providing significant advantages of scale.
