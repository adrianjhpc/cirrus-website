## Known Issues
The disk usage reporting is currently not work within the SAFE. We are looking to resolve the issue with the uploading of the data from Cirrus. 
In the meantime, please check your disk usage on Cirrus or contact the Service Desk if you require assistance. 

### Current Issues

A file system controller is currently experiencing very high load, so users may experience slow file system response. Our systems team are working with the vendor to resolve the issue.

### Recent Issues

There was a planned maintenance outage from 09:00-15:30 on Wednesday 7th April 2021. The maintenance session was concluded successfully, and Cirrus is back in service.

There are regular 'At-Risk' maintenance sessions on Wednesdays from 1000-1200. 

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
