### Current Issues

#### Monday 8th February 8:00  

A powercut affecting a large part of SE Scotland last night has affected machines and hosting services based at our ACF centre. <br>
At present Cirrus is unavailable for users to log on. <br>
Our team are on site and we will provide further updates as soon as possible. <br>
We apologise for this unplanned interruption to service.


### Recent Issues

#### Monday 8th February 9:30  SAFE restored

SAFE was also unavailable due to the power outage so the Service Desk were unable to see or respond to user queries. <br>
SAFE has now been restored and our team are responding as quickly as possible to queries.

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

As you are aware, we have regular 'At-Risk' maintenance sessions on Wednesdays from 1000-1200. 

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions
There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

Wednesday 27th January 1000 - 1200 GMT
There is an 'At-Risk' Session today. 

There will be a change to the Slurm configuration for the GPU Nodes, which will increase the user limits from 16 GPUs to 64 GPUs. 
This has been completed. 

We do not expect the maintenance to have any impact on users but please report any issues you experience to support@cirrus.ac.uk 

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
