## Service Calendar and Maintenance

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

As you are aware, we have regular 'At-Risk' maintenance sessions on Wednesdays from 1000-1200. 

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions
There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

Wednesday 25th November 1000 - 1200 GMT
There is an 'At-Risk' Session to change the Slurm configuration for the GPU Nodes. There will be a 1 hour reservation for the GPU nodes where they will be unavailable to users. Submitted jobs will queue and will start once the reservation is complete. 

We do not expect the maintenace to have any impact on users but please report any issues you experience to support@cirrus.ac.uk 

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
