## Known Issues

### Current Issues

#### Friday 11th October
We have noticed that there is a discrepency between the default mpt module versions on login and compute nodes.
In order to ensure consistency we would recommend using

  module load mpt/2.18 
  
to specify the version explicitly whilst we resolve this.

### Recent Issues

Cirrus was experiencing issues with parts of the network leading to some jobs failing to run. Our systems team have now resolved these issues.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused.

### Postponed: Planned Maintenance Wednesday 21st August

The planned Cirrus Maintenance on Wedensday 21st August  9:00am - 17:00  will now be postponed.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused and further notification will be sent once we have confirmed the new date. 

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
