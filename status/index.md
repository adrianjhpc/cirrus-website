## Service Calendar and Maintenance


### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

#### Wednesday 18th August 

Essential networking work will take place at the Advanced Computing Facility (ACF). 

We expect the outage will be very short, and will take place between 10:00 and 15:00. 

During this period, your connection to the User Access Node (UAN) may be lost. Please wait a couple of minutes and then try to reconnect. 

File transfers may be affected.

Jobs running on the compute nodes will not be impacted. 

We will send a user mailing once the work is completed. 

<!--There are regular 'At-Risk' maintenance sessions on Wednesdays from 1000-1200. -->

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
