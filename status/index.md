**Cirrus network issue Monday 14th September 1200 BST**

There was a brief network outage which affected access to Cirrus and also some of our other services shortly after 12:00 today, Monday 14th September.
Access was restored within a few minutes and appears to be stable now. Our team are investigating the root cause. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

**Cirrus Update Friday 11th September 1730 BST**

Cirrus is now fully restored to service. HPE have been on site this week working with our systems team and following extensive checks are happy to restore the service.

Please let us know if you experience any issues and we apologise for the inconvenience caused by this unplanned outage.

**Cirrus down Tuesday 8th September 1300 BST**

We're very sorry that Cirrus is currently offline. Yesterday during routine replacement of failed memory in one of the compute nodes by an HPE maintenance contractor, a water cooling valve failed to close when the node was withdrawn. Water then escaped from the cooling system. Cirrus was shut down immediately and the failed valve identified. Replacement parts are being supplied by HPE and will be installed over the next couple of days. We are also taking the opportunity, given the system is now empty of cooling water, to inspect the other valves in the system. This is a very unusual occurrence.

We hope to have Cirrus back online by the end of the week and will keep you informed of progress.

We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this unplanned outage and thank you for your patience.


## Service Calendar and Maintenance

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

**Full Maintenance Session Wednesday 26th August 1830 BST**

Apologies for the slight delay, Cirrus has now been returned to full service.
We appreciate your patience during this planned outage. 
Please contact the Service Desk if you experience any issues. 

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
