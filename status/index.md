## Known Issues

### Current Issues

#### Friday 11th October

We have noticed that there is a discrepency between the default mpt module versions on login and compute nodes.
In order to ensure consistency we would recommend using

  module load mpt/2.18 
  
to specify the version explicitly whilst we resolve this.

### Recent Issues

#### Urgent maintenance outage 11:30 - 18:00 17/10/19 ####

The urgent maintenance session completed successfully, ahead of schedule, at 16:05.
Queued jobs have begun running once more and Cirrus is available.
Analysis of the queues indicates that most jobs had completed before the maintenance but if your jobs have been killed please get in touch for a refund.

We apologise for the inconvenience caused.

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions
