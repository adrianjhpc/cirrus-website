## Known Issues

### Current Issues

#### 21 January 2019: Cirrus service status. ####

There are 36 compute nodes unavailable due to an ongoing issues. The faulty hardware has been replaced but there are still issues with the interconnect on the affected Cirrus nodes which are being investigated by the Cirrus systems team and HPE engineers.

The Data Services Node (DSN) **is** available.

Apologies for any ongoing inconvenience. Please let [the helpdesk](../support/) know if you have any questions or experience any other issues.

### Recent Issues

#### 11 January 2019, 16:30: Cirrus service restored. ####

We have successfully restored Cirrus to service, at 16:30 Friday 11th January.
* The GPU nodes are available
* There are 36 compute nodes unavailable due to an ongoing hardware issue
* The Data Services Node (DSN) is currently unavailable

We expect the unavailable nodes to be available once the hardware issue is resolved and hope that this should be in the first half of next week.

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions
