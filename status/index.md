## Service Calendar and Maintenance

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

#### 1100-1400 BST, 19 September 2018

Login, Data Services Node (DSN) and Compute Nodes will all be unavailable during this maintenance session.

**Activities planned:**
* Installation of new GPU hardware (Nvidia V100 "Volta" nodes)

**Impact of changes on users:**

The installation of the new hardware will have no immediate impact for users. Following the hardware
installation, we will be performing tests, working to integrate the GPU nodes into the Cirrus
queue setup and producing documentation for users.

We will notify all users once the new hardware is available for use and how to access it.
