**Cirrus network issue Monday 14th September 1200 BST**

There was a brief network outage which affected access to Cirrus and also some of our other services shortly after 12:00 today, Monday 14th September.
Access was restored within a few minutes and appears to be stable now. Our team are investigating the root cause. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

As you are aware, we have regular 'At-Risk' maintenance sessions on Wednesdays from 1000-1200. 

During the session tomorrow, a missing firmware from the GPU node enclosures will be installed. A reservation has been put in place on the system to prevent GPU work running after 0800. This is needed because the switches providing the nodes with their operating system filesystem will be rebooted during the process, which is likely to cause disruption to running work. The reservation will be removed as soon as the work is complete.

This should be 'At-Risk' for the system as a whole as any issues with the optical network on the GPU nodes should not affect the rest of the system.

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
