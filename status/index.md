### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

### Full Cirrus Outage:  Wednesday 31st March 0900-1700 BST
A full outage is required for essential work on Cirrus. 

The work will impact the full Cirrus service and so you will not be able to connect to the Cirrus login nodes and no jobs will run during this time on the Cirrus CPU and GPU nodes.

The Cirrus status page (https://www.cirrus.ac.uk/status/) will be updated throughout the work and users will be notified when the Cirrus service is available.
We apologise for the inconvenience that may be caused by this essential outage.

There are also regular 'At-Risk' maintenance sessions on Wednesdays from 1000-1200. 

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
