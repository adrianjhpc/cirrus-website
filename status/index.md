### Current Issues

** Cirrus down Monday 7th September 11:00 BST **

Cirrus is unavailable due to a valve failure in the coolant system. 
The system will need to remain powered down until it can be replaced.
Our systems team are working with HPE to restore service as quickly as possible, and we hope to be able to provide a further update tomorrow.

We apologise for the inconvenience.

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions

**Full Maintenance Session Wednesday 26th August 1830 BST**

Apologies for the slight delay, Cirrus has now been returned to full service.
We appreciate your patience during this planned outage. 
Please contact the Service Desk if you experience any issues. 

### At Risk Maintenance Sessions

There is an 'At-Risk' Session provisionally booked every Wednesday from 1000 - 1200. 
A user mailing will be sent if any work is going to take place which may impact users.

### Service Calendar

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
