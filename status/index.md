## Known Issues

### Current Issues

#### 25 January 2019: Cirrus interconnect issues ####

The system is now available to users following the recent Infiniband interconnect issues and users should be able to submit jobs as normal. However, the systems team and vendor engineers are continuing investigations into the underlying casue of the issues with the interconnect. As the underlying cause of the issues has not been determined, users should be aware that the system is running "at risk".  

Please let [the helpdesk](../support/) know if you experience any issues with your jobs. As usual, we will refund the resources for any jobs that are affected by issues with the Cirrus hardware.

### Recent Issues

#### 24 January 2019: Cirrus interconnect issues

We are currently seeing issues with the Infiniband interconnect that can cause user jobs to fail. The queues are disabled while we work on this issue to prevent jobs from failing and wasting resources. The login nodes and Data Services Node (DSN) remain available so that users can continue to access their data.

Apologies for any ongoing inconvenience. Please let the [the helpdesk](../support/) know if you have any questions or experience any other issues.

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.
