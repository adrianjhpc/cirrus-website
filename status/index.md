## Known Issues

### Current Issues

Cirrus will be unavailable today, Tuesday 12th May 2020,  as we continue to investigate the security incident that was discovered yesterday.  Jobs that are currently running or queued will continue to run, but you will be unable to log in or to submit new jobs.  We will bring Cirrus back into service as soon as is safely possible to minimise disruption to the user community.  We hope to be in a position by tomorrow to provide a clearer idea of timescales for service resumption  and will provide a further update tomorrow.

We appologise for the inconvenience caused.  If you have any particular questions or concerns please get in touch via the service desk.

## Service Calendar and Maintenance

We maintain a calendar for the Cirrus service that lists upcoming events (such
as training courses and maintenance sessions):

- [Cirrus Service Calendar](calendar.html)

We keep maintenance downtime to a minimum on the service but do occaisionally
need to perform essential work on the system. Maintenance sessions are used to 
ensure that:

* software versions are kept up to date;
* firmware levels on HPE and third-party peripheral equipment are kept up to date;
essential security patches are applied;
* failed/suspect hardware can be replaced;
* new software can be installed;
periodic essential maintenance on HPE electrical and mechanical support equipment (refrigeration systems, air blowers and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely.

Additional maintenance sessions can be scheduled for major hardware or software updates; major upgrades to facility plant and infrastructure; acceptance testing following major service upgrades and statutory electrical testing.

### Upcoming Maintenance Sessions
