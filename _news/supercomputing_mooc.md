title: Introduction to Supercomputing MOOC
date: 2017-03-09

"Supercomputing" is a free 5-week online course designed for anyone interested in leading-edge computing technology, supercomputers or the role that computer simulation takes in modern science and engineering.

## Supercomputing

Todayâ€™s supercomputers are the most powerful calculating machines ever invented, capable of performing more than a thousand million million calculations every second. This gives scientists and engineers a powerful new tool to study the natural world: computer simulation.

This course will introduce students to what supercomputers are, how they are used and how we can exploit their full computational potential to make scientific breakthroughs.

> Building on our experiences of running introductory technical
> courses and public engagement and outreach events, we have put
> together a course that explores the fundamental concepts and
> applications of supercomputing using a range of articles, videos,
> exercises and discussions. No programming experience is required,
> this is like a 'supercomputers for dummies' course! We try to
> use simple analogies and everyday examples to explain how
> supercomputers are built and the challenges we face in exploiting
> their enormous potential power.
