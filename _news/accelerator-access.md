Cirrus is the newest member of the
[EPCC Accelerator](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/work-us/industry-engagement-programmes/accelerator)
service designed specifically to provide access to leading advanced computing resources
for industry.

The Accelerator service delivers high-performance computing (HPC) capability
at a fraction of the cost of buying and operating your own in-house HPC capability.
Accelerator can be used as a:

* Transformative HPC resource accelerating your development and discovery lifecycles;
* Flexible HPC resource smoothing out your own demand peaks;
* Contingency over internal HPC infrastructure failure.

[EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk) provides a number of different way to get access
through Accelerator:

* Direct Access: For users conversant with using HPC platforms, direct and immediate
access on a pay-per-use basis is provided;
* Self-Assessed Free Trial: We can set you up with a free trial on any of our service
machines so that you can undertake your own test drive, piloting and benchmarking activities;
* Assisted Adopter Programme: We will work with you to facilitate the seamless mapping of
your in-house workflows complete with user specific documentation and training.
