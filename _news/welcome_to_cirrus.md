**Welcome to Cirrus, the latest advanced computing service from
[EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk).**

The Cirrus service is designed to provide a flexible, powerful
advanced computing solution for both academic research and
for industry.

## What is Cirrus?

Cirrus is based around the core compute resource: a 200 node 
[SGI ICE XA](http://www.sgi.com/products/servers/ice/ice_xa.html)
high performance computing (HPC) cluster. The compute nodes 
each contain two 18-core Xeon *Broadwell* processors and have
256 GiB memory. The compute nodes are all linked using a low
latency, high bandwidth FDR Infiniband network.

For more information on the Cirrus hardware please see:

* [Cirrus Hardware](/about/hardware.html)

As well as the basic hardware, Cirrus also includes a wide range
of preinstalled modelling and simulation software, data analysis
tools, and scientific libraries. Further details of the software 
available on Cirrus can be found at:

## How can I get help on using Cirrus?

Users on Cirrus are supported by EPCC's wold-leading team of
advanced computing specialists with expertise in HPC, data
science, software engineering, and much more. Initial support
is provided by the [Cirrus User Guide](http://cirrus.readthedocs.io/)
written by EPCC experts and further support is available 
via the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).

If you have a project in mind but require a large amount of
technical support to get up and running then please
contact the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/) and we will be more
than happy to discuss options with you.

## How do I get access to Cirrus?

We provide a number of access mechanisms for both academic and
indutrial users.

For academic users, the easiest place to start is with an 
*Instant Access* application. This lightweight application will
give you resources to try Cirrus out for your research and help
you calculate how much resource you wiuld require for a larger
application.

For industry users, you should look at
[EPCC Accelerator](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/work-us/industry-engagement-programmes/accelerator)
which has a number of different ways to get access, depending on
your individual requirements.

Further information on access routes is available on the 
Access page:
