      <a href="http://www.archer.ac.uk">ARCHER, the UK national supercomputing service</a> offers a capability resource for running
      very large parallel jobs. Based around a 118,080 core Cray XC system, the service includes
      a helpdesk staffed by HPC experts from EPCC with support from Cray Inc. Access is free at
      point of use for academic researchers working in the EPSRC and NERC domains. Users can also purchase 
      access at a variety of rates. Industry access is available.

        DiRAC is the STFC HPC facility for particle physics and astronomy researchers. It is
        currently made up of five different systems with different architectures. These range from
        an extreme scaling IBM BG/Q system, a large SGI/HPE UV SMP system, and a number of
        Intel Xeon multicore HPC systems. Free access is available to academic researchs working
        in the STFC domain; academic researchers from other domains can purchase access. Industry
        access is also available.
