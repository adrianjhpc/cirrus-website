## Why Readthedocs?

We use Readthedocs to host the Cirrus documentation for a number of reasons:

* It provides a good interface for technical documentation
* The same documentation source generates both online and PDF versions
  of the information
* The user community can contribute to the documentation simply by
  forking the open source GitHub repoistory and creating pull requests
* The documentation is writtin in simple plain-text format making it
  easy to update and maintain
