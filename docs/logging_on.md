summary: How to get logged on to Cirrus following the upgrade June 2020
---


Following the Cirrus return to service post upgrade, there have been some changes to login authentication.

User require both a SSH key and password.  Both will have to be new before users can access the system. 


You upload the public part of the key pair to your Cirrus machine account using the Tier2 SAFE as follows:

Login to SAFE at https://www.archer.ac.uk/tier2/. Then:

1. Go to the Menu "Login accounts" and select the Cirrus account you want to add the SSH key to 
2. On the subsequent Login account details page click the "Add Credential" button 
3. Select "SSH public key" as the Credential Type and click "Next"
4. Either copy and paste the public part of your SSH key into the “SSH Public key” box or use the button to select the public key file on your computer.
5. Click "Add" to associate the public SSH key part with your account

The public SSH key part will now be added to your login account on the Cirrus system.
