Access through EPSRC grants
===========================

On J-eS, access can be requested by including Cirrus costs on a
standard EPSRC grant application.

A completed
[Grant/Open Access Technical Assessment (TA)](ta/Cirrus-TA-GrantOpen-form.docx) must be uploaded
along with the application as a supporting document. 

**Cost of access to Cirrus is still being finalised, if you wish to
include Cirrus on an EPSRC grant then please contact the
[Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).**

Access through other grant-awarding bodies
==========================================

Cirrus costs can be included in applications from other grant awarding
bodies.

You should complete a  [Grant/Open Access Technical Assessment (TA)](ta/Cirrus-TA-GrantOpen-form.docx)  form and
send to the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/) ahead of your proposal 
submission. The completed TA form can then be included along with your
application as required.
