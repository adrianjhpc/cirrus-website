Application Proceedure
----------------------

A [Cirrus Early Access Technical Assessment Form](ta/Cirrus-TA-EarlyAccess-form.docx)
should be completed by you and sent to the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).

The Cirrus CSE service will evaluate the technical feasibility of the project,
and the service will ensure that the work lies within EPSRC remit.

If the technical assessment is successful and the work is within remit, your 
project will be set up on Cirrus.
