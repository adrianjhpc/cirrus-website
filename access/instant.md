Apply for Instant Access to Cirrus
==================================

As a pump priming opportunity for new users, EPSRC offer instant
access to Cirrus for a limited number of CPUh over a six month period.
This mode of access should give new users the opportunity to test Cirrus
for their purposes and work towards a fully peer reviewed application,
either via a [standard grant](grant.html) or via
[National Open Access calls](noa.html). An extension will only be granted
in exceptional cases.

Application Proceedure
----------------------

You can apply for a maximum of 7,000 CPUh over a six month period to test
the Cirrus service for your work.

A [Cirrus Instant Access Technical Assessment Form](ta/Cirrus-TA-Instant-form.docx)
shouldbe completed by you and sent to the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).

The Cirrus CSE service will evaluate the technical feasibility of the project,
while EPSRC will ensure that the work lies within its remit.

These short projects are not evaluated further, unless an extension is required.
