Access Cirrus
=============

Information on how to get access to Cirrus. How you get access depends on 
if you are working in industry or academia and how much resource you require.

Industry Access
---------------

Cirrus has been designed to support a wide range of industry applications 
and EPCC can provide both access to HPC resources and also consultancy to
effectively exploit HPC resources.

For access to Cirrus and EPCC expertise please contact George Graham
(<g.graham@epcc.ed.ac.uk>, +44 131 651 3460) and see the 
[EPCC Accelerator](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/work-us/industry-engagement-programmes/accelerator)
page.

Academic Access
---------------

Cirrus is one of the [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk) Tier-2 National HPC facilities and
so the access method for academic researchers is different depending on if your 
research falls within EPSRC remit or not.

### EPSRC Access

If your research falls under the EPSRC remit then you can use a number of
different access routes (please follow the links for further information):

* [Instant Access](instant.html): small amounts of time and storage space to explore use of Cirrus for your research
* [EPSRC RAP Open Access](open.html): Larger amounts of compute time and storage space for up to 12 months
* [Grant Access](grant.html): Larger amounts of time and storage for lifetime of research grant

In all cases, you should complete a Cirrus Technical Assessment form. This short form allows our technical experts to ensure that your project will get the most out of access to Cirrus and will help us to make sure that Cirrus can support the research you wish to undertake.  

### Other grant awarding bodies and researchers outside the UK

* [Grant Access](grant.html): Larger amounts of time and storage for lifetime of
