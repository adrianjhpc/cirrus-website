Access to Cirrus for researchers at Scottish academic institutions
==================================================================

Researchers at Scottish academic institutions can get free access to Cirrus for 
their research. This can be either a small amount of time for test access or 
larger amounts for production-type runs.

**Note:** If you wish to include Cirrus access in a grant application you should 
use the [grant process](grant.html) rather than this method.

**Note:** Only researchers in Scottish academic institutions are eligible.

**Note:** Typically, only one Scottish Access application will be funded per 
researcher. Short, trial-access, projects can be converted into longer access
with larger resources if the trial is successful.

Resources Available
-------------------

Although there is no limit on the amount of resource that can be requested through the
Scottish academic access mechanism, we would expect applications for test access to be
a maximum of around 15,000 CPUh and production access would be for a maximum of 
1,000,000 CPUh. 

Test access will be for 6 months and production access for 1 year.

Application Proceedure
----------------------

A [Cirrus Scottish Academic Access Technical Assessment Form](ta/Cirrus-TA-ScotAccess-form.docx)
should be completed by you and sent to the [Cirrus Helpdesk](/support/).

The Cirrus CSE service will evaluate the technical feasibility of the project and this will
be passed to Cirrus management for approval.
