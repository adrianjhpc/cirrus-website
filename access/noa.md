National Open Access (NOA) Calls
================================

**Note that NOA calls have not yet been finalised or released.**

NOA Access is available through regular calls throughout the service.

**Note that NOA is restricted to projects in the EPSRC remit.**

EPSRC offers access to ARCHER through calls for proposals to the National
Open Access (NOA) calls. Users can request significant amounts of computing
resource over a maximum 1 year period. The aim of this call is to provide
access to our new national tier-2 computing facilities for proposals of
high scientific quality that.

A non-exhaustive list of eligible projects includes:

* Short computational projects that do not warrant a full grant application
* UK led collaborative projects with international and/or industry partners
* Joint applications from students with proven HPC experience (e.g. a
  successfully completed Instant Access project) and their PIs
* Projects that link consecutive standard grant applications or that aid the
  preparation of a grant or fellowship application
* Extended feasibility studies and trialling application developments
