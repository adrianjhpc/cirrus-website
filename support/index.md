## EPCC Helpdesk

The Helpdesk is the first point of contact for all questions relating
to the Cirrus facility.

Support is available Monday to Friday from
08:30 until 18:00, excluding UK public holidays.

The Helpdesk can be reached by e-mail [support@cirrus.ac.uk](mailto:support@cirrus.ac.uk).

Please try and provide as much background information as possible as this will
speed up the processing time considerably. Existing Cirrus users will be asked
for their user ID, project code, and, where applicable, the commands they are
using and the error message they get.

## How the helpdesk ticket system works

When a query is submitted by email it is placed in the SAFE query system.

When you email your query, you will normally get an automatic acknowledgment by
email, including a tracking ID, within a few minutes. If you submit your query
through SAFE, it will give you a tracking ID at once. A few minutes later,
your query will be assigned to the appropriate expert within the Cirrus team
to handle.

The expert may contact you to discuss your problem or to get extra information.
Finally, the expert will send you an answer, and the query will be closed. At
this point the helpdesk will send you another message, telling you that this has
happened.

Closed queries are kept in the SAFE database, so that we can refer back to them
when solving future problems, and when writing documentation, etc. The SAFE
database is protected by the
[Cirrus Personal Data and Privacy Policy](/about/policies/privacy.html)

## Cirrus Annual User Survey

We are committed to continually improving the Cirrus Service and would like to request your input to help us understand better what is important to you, where the Service is working well, and where there is scope for improvement.

The Cirrus Annual User Survey consists of a few short questions and should take only a few minutes of your time to complete. There are opportunities to add more detailed comments if you wish.

For each survey response received, we will donate £1 to Save The Children.

We are also offering 3 prizes of 25,000 CPUh on Cirrus for users who complete the survey. Winners can choose to forgo the CPUh prize, and for each winner that does this we will donate a further £20 to Save The Children. Winners will be drawn at random from all respondents who have left contact details after the closing date of Wednesday 31st July 2019 and the winners notified by e-mail. The prizes are only available to people with existing Cirrus user accounts.

You can find the survey on the Cirrus Website at:

Thank you in advance for taking the time to complete this survey. The responses will be used to try and improve the service for all users and to help identify key areas for service development.
